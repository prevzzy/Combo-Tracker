# Combo-Tracker
Combo Tracker is an app that gathers and presents data about combos made in THUG Pro and reTHAWed. Its purpose is to significantly simplify analyzing combos, and help players improve and achieve their score goals faster. It is also destined to serve as an individual highscores list, that allows the user to have all of the data of their best combos available at all times.

It's worth noting, that although the combo data is almost completely obtained from inside the game, either directly or by mimicking the game engine's logic, the application only keeps track of the values. At no point does it modify any of the in-game values in any way.

## Download
You can download the application from the [releases](https://github.com/prevzzy/THUGPRO-Combo-Tracker/releases) page.

## Installation
No installation is required. After you downloaded the .zip, unpack it and simply launch the Combo Tracker.exe.
