# Combo-Tracker
[Combo Tracker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUP89ZRJVuk) is an app that gathers and presents data about combos made in THUG Pro, reTHAWed, Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and Tony Hawk's Underground 2. Its purpose is to significantly simplify analyzing combos, and help players improve and achieve their score goals faster. It is also destined to serve as an individual highscores list, that allows the user to have all of the data of their best combos available at all times.

It's worth noting, that although the combo data is almost completely obtained from inside the game, either directly or by mimicking the game engine's logic, the application only keeps track of the values. At no point does it modify any of the in-game values in any way.

## Supported Games
Combo Tracker currently supports THUG Pro, reTHAWed, Tony Hawk's Underground 2 and Tony Hawk's American Wasteland. **Make sure that the executable filenames match THUGPro.exe, reTHAWed.exe, THUG2.exe and THAW.exe** respectively. If you're using any modifications for these games, you may need to change the filename accordingly.

## Download
You can download the application from the [releases](https://github.com/prevzzy/THUGPRO-Combo-Tracker/releases) page.

## Installation
No installation is required. After you downloaded the .zip, unpack it and simply launch the Combo Tracker.exe.
