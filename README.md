# Combo Tracker
[Combo Tracker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUP89ZRJVuk) is an app that gathers and presents data about combos made in THUG Pro, reTHAWed, Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and Tony Hawk's Underground 2. Its purpose is to significantly simplify analyzing combos, and help players improve and achieve their score goals faster. It is also destined to serve as an individual highscores list, that allows the user to have all of the data of their best combos available at all times.

It's worth noting, that although the combo data is almost completely obtained from inside the game, either directly or by mimicking the game engine's logic, the application only keeps track of the values. At no point does it modify any of the in-game values in any way.

## Supported Games
Combo Tracker currently supports THUG Pro, reTHAWed, Tony Hawk's Underground 2 and Tony Hawk's American Wasteland.

## Download
You can download the application from the [releases](https://github.com/prevzzy/THUGPRO-Combo-Tracker/releases) page.

## Installation
No installation is required. After you downloaded the .zip, unpack it and simply launch the Combo Tracker.exe.

## Troubleshooting
Make sure that the games' executable filenames match THUGPro.exe, reTHAWed.exe, THUG2.exe and THAW.exe. If you're using any modifications for these games, you may need to change the filename accordingly.

Depending on the game version installed on your PC, you might experience issues with Combo Tracker failing to detect THUG2 and THAW games. The application has been tested to run with the executables provided at the bottom of [this page](https://github.com/prevzzy/Combo-Tracker/releases/tag/v1.1.0). If your game is running but you're still encountering the error messages "Could not find any active supported game process." or "Reinitializing addresses. Restart the game if the problem persists.", then try swapping your .exe files with the ones linked below. If this doesn't help, try running Combo Tracker as an administrator.
